5.1 Command responses

   Numerics in the range from 001 to 099 are used for client-server
   connections only and should never travel between servers.  Replies
   generated in the response to commands are found in the range from 200
   to 399.

       001    RPL_WELCOME
              "Welcome to the Internet Relay Network
               <nick>!<user>@<host>"
       002    RPL_YOURHOST
              "Your host is <servername>, running version <ver>"
       003    RPL_CREATED
              "This server was created <date>"

              "<servername> <version> <available user modes>
               <available channel modes>"

         - The server sends Replies 001 to 004 to a user upon
           successful registration.

       005    RPL_BOUNCE
              "Try server <server name>, port <port number>"

         - Sent by the server to a user to suggest an alternative
           server.  This is often used when the connection is
           refused because the server is already full.

       302    RPL_USERHOST
              ":*1<reply> *( " " <reply> )"

         - Reply format used by USERHOST to list replies to
           the query list.  The reply string is composed as
           follows:

           reply = nickname [ "*" ] "=" ( "+" / "-" ) hostname

           The '*' indicates whether the client has registered
           as an Operator.  The '-' or '+' characters represent
           whether the client has set an AWAY message or not
           respectively.

       303    RPL_ISON
              ":*1<nick> *( " " <nick> )"

         - Reply format used by ISON to list replies to the
           query list.

       301    RPL_AWAY
              "<nick> :<away message>"
       305    RPL_UNAWAY
              ":You are no longer marked as being away"
       306    RPL_NOWAWAY
              ":You have been marked as being away"

         - These replies are used with the AWAY command (if
           allowed).  RPL_AWAY is sent to any client sending a
           PRIVMSG to a client which is away.  RPL_AWAY is only
           sent by the server to which the client is connected.
           Replies RPL_UNAWAY and RPL_NOWAWAY are sent when the
           client removes and sets an AWAY message.

       311    RPL_WHOISUSER
              "<nick> <user> <host> * :<real name>"

       319    RPL_WHOISCHANNELS
              "<nick> :*( ( "@" / "+" ) <channel> " " )"

         - Replies 311 - 313, 317 - 319 are all replies
           generated in response to a WHOIS message.  Given that
           there are enough parameters present, the answering
           server MUST either formulate a reply out of the above
           numerics (if the query nick is found) or return an
           error reply.  The '*' in RPL_WHOISUSER is there as
           the literal character and not as a wild card.  For
           each reply set, only RPL_WHOISCHANNELS may appear
           more than once (for long lists of channel names).
           The '@' and '+' characters next to the channel name
           indicate whether a client is a channel operator or
           has been granted permission to speak on a moderated
           channel.  The RPL_ENDOFWHOIS reply is used to mark
           the end of processing a WHOIS message.

       314    RPL_WHOWASUSER
              "<nick> <user> <host> * :<real name>"
       369    RPL_ENDOFWHOWAS
              "<nick> :End of WHOWAS"

         - When replying to a WHOWAS message, a server MUST use
           the replies RPL_WHOWASUSER, RPL_WHOISSERVER or
           ERR_WASNOSUCHNICK for each nickname in the presented
           list.  At the end of all reply batches, there MUST
           be RPL_ENDOFWHOWAS (even if there was only one reply
           and it was an error).

       321    RPL_LISTSTART
              Obsolete. Not used.

       322    RPL_LIST
              "<channel> <# visible> :<topic>"
       323    RPL_LISTEND
              ":End of LIST"

         - Replies RPL_LIST, RPL_LISTEND mark the actual replies
           with data and end of the server's response to a LIST
           command.  If there are no channels available to return,
           only the end reply MUST be sent.

         - When sending a TOPIC message to determine the
           channel topic, one of two replies is sent.  If
           the topic is set, RPL_TOPIC is sent back else
           RPL_NOTOPIC.

       341    RPL_INVITING
              "<channel> <nick>"

         - Returned by the server to indicate that the

         - When listing the 'invitations masks' for a given channel,
           a server is required to send the list back using the
           RPL_INVITELIST and RPL_ENDOFINVITELIST messages.  A
           separate RPL_INVITELIST is sent for each active mask.
           After the masks have been listed (or if none present) a
           RPL_ENDOFINVITELIST MUST be sent.

           The <version> is the version of the software being
           used (including any patchlevel revisions) and the
           <debuglevel> is used to indicate if the server is
           running in "debug mode".

           The "comments" field may contain any comments about
           the version or further version details.

       352    RPL_WHOREPLY
              "<channel> <user> <host> <server> <nick>

       315    RPL_ENDOFWHO
              "<name> :End of WHO list"

         - The RPL_WHOREPLY and RPL_ENDOFWHO pair are used
           to answer a WHO message.  The RPL_WHOREPLY is only
           sent if there is an appropriate match to the WHO
           query.  If there is a list of parameters supplied
           with a WHO message, a RPL_ENDOFWHO MUST be sent
           after processing each list item with <name> being
           the item.

       353    RPL_NAMREPLY

       366    RPL_ENDOFNAMES
              "<channel> :End of NAMES list"

         - To reply to a NAMES message, a reply pair consisting
           of RPL_NAMREPLY and RPL_ENDOFNAMES is sent by the
           server back to the client.  If there is no channel
           found as in the query, then only RPL_ENDOFNAMES is

           message is sent with no parameters and all visible
           channels and contents are sent back in a series of
           RPL_NAMEREPLY messages with a RPL_ENDOFNAMES to mark
           the end.

           a server is required to send the list back using the
           RPL_BANLIST and RPL_ENDOFBANLIST messages.  A separate
           RPL_BANLIST is sent for each active banmask.  After the
           banmasks have been listed (or if none present) a

         - When replying to the TIME message, a server MUST send
           the reply using the RPL_TIME format above.  The string
           showing the time need only contain the correct day and
           time there.  There is no further requirement for the
           time string.

         - The RPL_TRACE* are all returned by the server in
           response to the TRACE message.  How many are
           returned is dependent on the TRACE message and
           whether it was sent by an operator or not.  There
           is no predefined order for which occurs first.
           Replies RPL_TRACEUNKNOWN, RPL_TRACECONNECTING and

           process of completing the 'server handshake'.
           RPL_TRACELINK is sent by any server which handles
           a TRACE message and has to pass it on to another
           server.  The list of RPL_TRACELINKs sent in
           response to a TRACE command traversing the IRC
           network should reflect the actual connectivity of
           the servers themselves along that path.

              "<mask> <type> :End of service listing"

         - When listing services in reply to a SERVLIST message,
           a server is required to send the list back using the
           RPL_SERVLIST and RPL_SERVLISTEND messages.  A separate
           RPL_SERVLIST is sent for each service.  After the
           services have been listed (or if none present) a
           RPL_SERVLISTEND MUST be sent.

       251    RPL_LUSERCLIENT

                servers"

         - In processing an LUSERS message, the server
           sends a set of replies from RPL_LUSERCLIENT,
           RPL_LUSEROP, RPL_USERUNKNOWN,
           RPL_LUSERCHANNELS and RPL_LUSERME.  When
           replying, a server MUST send back
           RPL_LUSERCLIENT and RPL_LUSERME.  The other
           replies are only sent back if a non-zero count
           is found for them.

              ":<admin info>"
       259    RPL_ADMINEMAIL
              ":<admin info>"

         - When replying to an ADMIN message, a server
           is expected to use replies RPL_ADMINME
           through to RPL_ADMINEMAIL and provide a text
           message with each.  For RPL_ADMINLOC1 a
           description of what city, state and country
           the server is in is expected, followed by
           details of the institution (RPL_ADMINLOC2)
